;;; Commentary:

;; This is a combination of some features of swbuff-x (Kahlil (Kal)
;; HODGSON <dorge@tpg.com.au>), which is a modification to swbuff
;; (David Ponce) and bs (Olaf Sylvester <olaf@geekware.de>)
;;
;; I really liked the nicely layouted and composed buffer-selection
;; buffer of bs.  However, also fast switching buffers with one
;; key-stroke and showing a temporary buffer with a buffer list (with
;; hide timeout) a la swbuff is nice.  So I combined both's
;; advantages.
;;
;; Some current problems are documented in the code.

;;; Usage:

;; Define keyboard shortcuts and load cycbuf.el as follows (init.el):
;;
;; (require 'cycbuf)
;; (global-set-key [(meta right)]       'cycbuf-switch-to-next-buffer)
;; (global-set-key [(meta left)]        'cycbuf-switch-to-previous-buffer)
;; (global-set-key [(meta super right)] 'cycbuf-switch-to-next-buffer-no-timeout)
;; (global-set-key [(meta super left)]  'cycbuf-switch-to-previous-buffer-no-timeout)

;;; Bugs:

;;  - Splitting windows does not work very well for very small frames sizes
;;  - large path names or buffer names may break column alignment

;;; Todo:

;; beautify column alignment stuff


;;; Changelog:

;; 0.5.0
;;  - added non-timeout version for cycling commands
;; 0.4.9
;;  - pipe car of cycbuf-file-name-replacements through expand-file-name
;; 0.4.8
;;  - incorporated some suggestions from Amilcar do Carmo Lucas
;;  - some code simplifications, now there are only two
;;    regexps (actually, lists of) for defining excluding /
;;    including buffer names, mostly to bsX-buffer-list
;;  - cycbuf-show-all is gone
;; 0.4.7
;;  - fixed buffer order restoration
;; 0.4.6
;;  - added cycbuf-sort-by-recency
